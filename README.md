# What is Smart-BallBot?  

Smart BallBot is an **automatic tennis ball collection robot**.
The robot could replace the role of 'ball person' picking up a tennis ball that fell to the bottom of the tennis court.
This will improve the convenience of tennis players and contribute to preventing the injury of 'ball person'.
